
The R language is highly enhanced by the installation of packages. 
Currently, there is a vast number of packages, with several of them implementing the same or similar data analysis methods.

The submitted manuscript is very interesting, since it compares a large number of packages that use Neural Networks (NN) for regression tasks.
In particular, it uses 3 key criteria to evaluate the packages: usability, time effort and performance.
Moreover, it benchmarks a quite large number of packages (60!).
As such, this manuscript is pertinent for the R community and R journal.
Overall, the presented methodology is sound and thus I recommend accept (with minor changes).

The minor changes are suggestions of aspects that can improve the manuscript:

- the writing could be improved in several cases, such as: removal of "oral" language: "thereâ€™s" -> "there is";
change of title "Neural Networks: The Perceptron" -> "Multilayer Perceptron with a Single Hidden Layer"; in Table 1 "nb." -> size.
- the NN acronym in Fig.1 is not detailed, nor the notation 1-3-1 is explained. Fig1 c) is not a single hidden layer networks.
- the examples in page 2 assume the tanh and atan activation functions, why not use f(), where f is the activation function, which can include the logistic function?
- in Phase 2, it could be explained how the NNbenchmark was used, with one example (and its characteristics).
- some figures, such as Fig2, should have a x-axis with numbers and labels.
- it should be explained that is a first order and second order algorithm.
