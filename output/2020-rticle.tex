\subsection{Abstract}\label{abstract}}

In the last three decades, neural networks (NN) have evolved from an
academic topic to a common scientific computing tool. CRAN currently
hosts approximately 80 packages in May 2020 involving neural network
modeling, some offering more than one algorithm. However, to our
knowledge, there is no comprehensive study which checks the accuracy,
the reliability and the ease-of-use of those NN packages.

In this paper, we attempted to test this rather large number of packages
against a common set of datasets with different levels of complexity,
and to benchmark and rank them with certain metrics.

Restricting our evaluation to regression algorithms applied on the
one-hidden layer perceptron and ignoring those for classification or
other specialized purposes, there were approximately 60
\code{package:algorithm} pairs left to test. The criteria used in our
benchmark were: (i) the accuracy, i.e.~the ability to find the global
minima on 13 datasets, measured by the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) in
a limited number of iterations; (ii) the speed of the training
algorithm; (iii) the availability of helpful utilities; (iv) and the
quality of the documentation.

We have attempted to give a score for each evaluation criterion and to
rank each \code{package:algorithm} pair in a global table. Overall, 15
pairs are considered accurate and reliable and can be recommended for
daily usage. Most others should be avoided as they are either less
accurate, too slow, too difficult to handle, or have poor or no
documentation.

To carry out this work, we developed various codes and templates, as
well as the NNbenchmark package used for testing. This material is
available at \url{https://akshajverma.com/NNbenchmarkWeb/index.html} and
\url{https://github.com/pkR-pkR/NNbenchmark}, and can be used to verify
our work and, we hope, improve both packages and their evaluation.
Finally, we provide some hints and features to guide the development of
an idealized neural network package for R.

\hypertarget{introduction}{%
\subsection{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

The \textsf{R} Project for Statistical Computing by \citep{Rsoft20}, as
any opensource platform, relies on its contributors to keep it up to
date. Neural networks (NN), inspired on the brain's own connections
system, are a class of models in the growing field of machine learning
for which \textsf{R} has a number of tools. During the last 30 years,
neural networks have evolved from an academic topic to a common tool in
scientific computing. Previously, neural networks were often considered
theoretically instead of pragmatically, partly because the algorithms
used were computationally demanding.

As a convenience in the general conversation, the same term is used in a
generic manner for different model structures and applications:
multilayer perceptron for regression, multilayer perceptron for
classification, multilayer perceptron for specialized applications,
recurrent neural network for autoregressive time series, convolutional
neural networks for dimension reduction and pattern recognition, and
even deep neural networks for image or voice recognition. Most of the
above types of neural networks can be found in R packages hosted on CRAN
but without any warranty about the accuracy or the speed of computation.
This is an issue as many slow or poor algorithms are available in the
literature and hence poor packages are implemented on CRAN.

A neural network algorithm requires complicated calculations to improve
the model control parameters. As with other optimization problems, the
gradient of the chosen cost function that indicates the lack the model's
suitability is sought. This lets us improve the model by changing the
parameters in the negative gradient direction. Parameters for the model
are generally obtained using part of the available data (a training set)
and tested on the remaining data. Modern software allows much of this
work, including approximation of the gradient, to be carried out without
a large effort by the user.

The training process can generally be made more efficient if we can also
approximate second derivatives of the cost function, allowing us to use
its curvature via the Hessian matrix. There are a large number of
approaches, of which quasi-Newton algorithms are perhaps the most common
and useful. Within this group, methods based on the
Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) algorithm for updating the
(inverse) Hessian approximation provide several well-known examples. In
conducting this study, we believed that these second-order algorithms
would perform better than first-order methods for fit-in-memory
datasets.

Regardless of our belief, we wished to be able to conduct a thorough
examination of these training algorithms in \textsf{R}. There are many
packages, but barely any information to allow comparison. Our work,
reported here, aims to provide a framework for benchmarking neural
network packages. We restrict our examination to packages for R, and in
this report focus on those that provide neural networks of the
perceptron type, that is, one input layer, one normalized layer, one
hidden layer with a nonlinear activation function that is usually the
hyperbolic tangent \(\tanh()\), and one output layer.

Moreover, We restricted our evaluation to one-hidden layer perceptron
for regression and ignored those for classification or other specialized
purposes. The criteria used in our benchmark were: (i) the accuracy,
i.e.~the ability to find the global minima on 13 datasets in a limited
number of iterations; (ii) the speed of the training algorithm; (iii)
the availability of helpful utilities; (iv) and the quality of the
documentation.

\hypertarget{neural-networks-the-perceptron}{%
\section{Neural Networks: the
perceptron}\label{neural-networks-the-perceptron}}

Here, we give a short description of the one hidden layer perceptron. As
the ``layer'' term suggests it, some terms come from the representation
of graphs whereas some other terms come from the traditional literature
on nonlinear models.

Using the graph description, a one-hidden layer neural network is made
of 3 parts: (i) the layer of the input(s), (ii) the hidden layer which
consists of independent neurons, each of them performing two operations:
a linear combination of the inputs plus an offset, then a nonlinear
function applied on this linear combination. (iii) the layer of the
output(s) which is a linear combination of the output of the nonlinear
functions in the hidden layer.

The nonlinear function used in the hidden layer must have the following
four properties: continuous, differentiable, monotonic, bounded. The
logistic (\(\text{invlogit}\)), the hyperbolic tangent (\(\tanh\)) and
the arctangent (\(\text{atan}\)) functions are the usual candidates. The
above description has a simple mathematical equivalence. Let us give two
examples.

The model
\(y = a_1 + a_2\times \tanh(a_3 + a_4\times x) + a_5\times \tanh(a_6 + a_7\times x) + a_8\times \tanh(a_9 + a_{10}\times x)\)
describes a neural network (Fig. 1a) with one input, three hidden
neurons, one output model where \(x\) is the input, \(\tanh()\) is the
activation function, \(y\) is the output and \(a_1,\dots,a_{10}\) are
the parameters.

The model
\(y = a_1 + a_2\times \text{atan}(a_3 + a_4\times x_1 + a_5\times x_2 + a_6\times x_3 + a_7\times x_4 + a_8\times x_5) + a_9\times \text{atan}(a_{10} + a_{11}\times x_1 + a_{12}\times x_2 + a_{13}\times x_3 + a_{14}\times x_4 + a_{15}\times x_5) + a_{16}\text{atan}(a_{17} + a_{18}\times x_1 + a_{19}\times x_2 + a_{20}\times x_3 + a_{21}\times x_4 + a_{22}\times x_5)\)
describes a neural network (Fig. 1b) with five inputs, three hidden
neurons, one output model where \(x\) is the input, \(\text{atan}()\) is
the activation function, \(y\) is the output and \(a_1,\dots,a_{22}\)
are the parameters.

In order to get large gradients at the first steps of the training
algorithm, it is recommended to use normalized inputs and normalized
outputs (Fig. 1c), odd functions like the hyperbolic tangent function or
the arctangent function, and small random values to initialize the
parameters, for instance extracted from a centered Gaussian
\(\mathcal N(0, 0.1)\) distribution. Such good practices help find good
local minima and possibly the global minimum.

The dataset used for the training is assumed to have a number of rows
much larger than the number of parameters. While ``much larger'' is
subject to discussion, values of 3 to 5 are generally accepted (in
experimental design, some iterative strategies start with a dataset
having a number of distinct experiments equal to 1.8 times the number of
parameters and then increase the number of experiments to fine tune the
model).

It is rather clear from the mathematical formula above that neural
networks of perceptron type are nonlinear models and require for their
parameter estimation some training algorithms that can handle (highly)
nonlinear models. Indeed, the intrinsic and parametric curvatures of
such models are usually very high and, with so many parameters, the
Jacobian matrix might exhibit some colinearities between its columns and
become nearly singular. As a result, appropriate algorithms for such
\code{dataset::model} pairs are rather limited and well-known. They
pertain to the class of second-order algorithms such as the BFGS
algorithm which is Quasi-Newton in how it updates the approximate
inverse Hessian or the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm which stabilizes
the Gauss-Newton search direction at every iteration.

Unfortunately, due to some educative tools on the backpropagation, and
an initial literature on the gradient in the early researches and more
recently on the ``deep neural networks'' that manipulate ultra-large
models with hundreds or thousands parameters (and sometimes more
parameters than examples in the datasets), many papers emphasize the use
of first-order gradient algorithms. Therefore, many \textsf{R} packages
have implemented such algorithms. In the case of the perceptron, we
contend this is an error, and provide evidence to that effect in this
paper. We refer interested readers to \citep{tan2019review} for a review
of second-order algorithms for neural networks.

\hypertarget{methodology}{%
\section{Methodology}\label{methodology}}

\hypertarget{convergence-and-termination}{%
\subsection{Convergence and
termination}\label{convergence-and-termination}}

Most of the \code{package:algorithm} pairs try to minimize the root mean
squared error (RMSE) during the training step. Two exceptions are the
\CRANpkg{brnn} package which minimizes the RMSE plus the sum of the
parameters (hence the name Bayesian Regularized Neural Network), and the
\CRANpkg{qrnn} package which performs quantile regression. For all
packages, the datasets were learnt as a whole and without any weighting
scheme to favour one part of the datasets. There was no validation
subset or test subset as the purpose of our study is just to verify the
ability to reach good minima.

When training neural networks, we attempt to tune a set of
hyperparameters so that the root mean squared error (RMSE) is minimized.
When our method for such adjustment can no longer reduce the RMSE, we
say that the given algorithm \textbf{terminated}. We consider the method
to have \textbf{converged} when termination is not due to some
exceptional situation and the final RMSE value is relatively
small\footnote{We do not choose the mean absolute error (MAE) for
  overall ranking nor for convergence testing as there is a lack of
  consensus in the literature, see
  e.g.~\citep{willmott2005advantages,chai2014root}.}. In practice, some
algorithms require that we stop the optimization process in exceptional
situations (e.g., a divide by zero), or a pre-set limit on the number of
steps or a maximum elapsed time is reached.

More precisely, second-order algorithms are all set to a maximum of 200
iterations. On the other hand, first-order algorithms were set to
several values, depending on how well and how fast they converged:
\texttt{maxit1storderA=1000} iterations, \texttt{maxit1storderB=10000}
iterations, and \texttt{maxit1storderC=100000} iterations. The full list
of the maximum iteration number per \code{package:algorithm} is given in
Table 4 in Appendix D. It can be seen that we were unable to completely
harmonize the hyperparameters as an appropriate learning rate differed
between packages, despite the algorithm being similarly named.

\hypertarget{performance}{%
\subsection{Performance}\label{performance}}

We measure \textbf{performance} primarily by relative computing time
between methods on a particular computing platform. We could also count
measures of iterations, function evaluations or similar quantities that
indicate the computing effort. We note that differences in machine
architecture and in the attached libraries (e.g., BLAS choices for
\textsf{R}) will modify our measures. We are putting our tools on a
Github repository so that further evaluation can be made by ourselves
and others as hardware and software evolves.

The resulting files in our repository were mostly generated by one of us
(SM) on a Windows system build 10.0.18362.752 with an i7-8750H CPU, an
Intel(R) UHD Graphics 630 and NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 chip, and 16 GB of
RAM. Tests have also been performed on other platforms: computation
times were reasonably similar.

\subsection{Phase 1 - Preparation of benchmark datasets and selection of
packages}\label{phase-1---preparation-of-benchmark-datasets-and-selection-of-packages}}

\textbf{Datasets}

A non-iterative calculation such as Ordinary Least Squares cannot
generally be used to model all the datasets in our evaluation set.
Varying levels of difficulty in modeling the different data sets are
intended to allow us to further classify different algorithms and the
packages that implement them. As we focus on regression analysis, we
select only datasets where the response variable is real-valued.

Sonja Surjanovic and Derek Bingham of Simon Fraser University created a
useful website from which three of the multivariate datasets were drawn.
We note the link, name and difficulty level of the three datasets:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \url{http://www.sfu.ca/~ssurjano/fried.html}: \code{mFriedman},
  Friedman's dataset, published in \citep{friedman91} (average
  difficulty),\\
\item
  \url{http://www.sfu.ca/~ssurjano/detpep10curv.html}: \code{mDette},
  Dette's dataset, published in \citep{dettePepelyshev10} (medium
  difficulty),\\
\item
  \url{http://www.sfu.ca/~ssurjano/ishigami.html}: \code{mIshigami},
  Ishigami's dataset, published in \citep{ishigamietal90} (high
  difficulty).
\end{itemize}

The last multivariate dataset, \code{mRef153}, was used to teach neural
networks at ESPCI (The City of Paris Industrial Physics and Chemistry
Higher Educational Institution, \url{https://www.neurones.espci.fr/})
from 2003 to 2013 and is available in the proprietary software Neuro One
at \url{http://www.inmodelia.com/software.html}. This dataset presents
some interesting non-linear features.

\code{uDreyfus1} is a pure neural network which has no error. This can
make it difficult for algorithms that assume an error exists.
\code{uDreyfus2} is \code{uDreyfus1} with errors. Both are considered to
be of low difficulty and used to teach neural networks at ESPCI from
1991 to 2013. \code{uDmod1} and \code{uDmod2} are univariate datasets
with few observations but exhibit high nonlinear patterns and prove to
be very challenging datasets. The parameters are highly correlated and
singular Jacobian matrices often appear.

Three of the univariate datasets were taken from the US National
Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) website:
\url{https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/strd/nls/nls_main.shtml}. Namely
\code{uGauss1}, \code{uGauss2} and \code{uGauss3} published in
\citep[resp.]{rustnist96:Gauss1,rustnist96:Gauss2,rustnist96:Gauss3}
created by NIST to assess nonlinear least squares regressions are of
low, low and medium difficulty respectively.

The last univariate dataset, \code{uNeuroOne}, was also used to teach
the same course and is now available in the proprietary software Neuro
One at \url{http://www.inmodelia.com/software.html}. In Table 1, we list
some information on each dataset used in the first round of our
analysis: the number of neurons and the induced parameter number are
available in the last two columns.

\end{Schunk}

To build the final result table, we selected all four multivariate
datasets and 4 out of the 8 univariate datasets so that the overall
score does not overly weight the univariate datasets. Furthermore the
2019 GSoC code uses all 12 datasets. Our package still allows access to
all 12 datasets.

Finally, we also consider a Simon Wood test dataset, named
\code{bWoodN1}, used in \citep{wood2011fast} for benchmarking
generalized additive models. Precisely, we consider a generation of
Gaussian random variates \(Y_i\), \(i=1,\dots,n\) with the mean
\(\mu_i\) defined as \[
\mu_i = 1+ f_0(x_{i,0})+f_1(x_{i,1})+f_2(x_{i,2})+f_3(x_{i,3})
+f_4(x_{i,4})+f_0(x_{i,5})
\] and standard deviation \(\sigma=1/4\) where \(f_j\) are Simon Wood's
smooth functions defined in Appendix B, \(x_{i,j}\) are uniform variates
and \(n=20,000\). \code{bWoodN1} will only be used in the second round
of our analysis when the TOP5 packages will be further analyzed with 5
neurons resulting in 41 parameters.

Whatever the source of the test datasets, there are all available in
\CRANpkg{NNbenchmark}, so that maintainers or users can perform the
analysis.

\textbf{Packages}

Using \CRANpkg{RWsearch} \citep{R-RWsearch}, we sought to automate the
process of searching for neural network packages. All packages that have
``neural network'' as a keyword in the package title or in the package
description were included. In May 2020, around 80 packages fall into
this category. Packages \pkg{nlsr}, \pkg{minpack.lm}, \pkg{caret} were
added because the former 2 are important implementations of second-order
algorithms while the latter is the first cited meta package in the CRAN
task view for machine learning,
\url{https://CRAN.R-project.org/view=MachineLearning}, as well as a
dependency for some of the other packages tested. Restricting to
regression analysis left us with 49 \code{package:algorithm} pairs in
2019 and 60 \code{package:algorithm} pairs in 2020.

\hypertarget{phase-2---review-of-packages-and-development-of-a-benchmarking-template}{%
\subsection{Phase 2 - Review of packages and development of a
benchmarking
template}\label{phase-2---review-of-packages-and-development-of-a-benchmarking-template}}

Basically, each package was inspected 3 times. Each assessment is
described in detail below.

\textbf{1. The decision to exclude or include}

From documentation and example code, we learned that not all packages
selected by the automated search fit the scope of our research. Some
have no function to generate neural networks. Others were not regression
neural networks of the perceptron type or were only intended for very
specific purposes. Depending on the package, this could be decided as
easily as looking at the DESCRIPTION file or having to go through the
process of running some code and seeing the results.

\textbf{2. Templates for testing accuracy and speed}

Benchmarking with the template that was developed in 2019 and
encapsulated in the functions of 2020, keeping notes of whether or not
the package was easy to use.

As we inspected the packages, we developed a template for benchmarking.
The structure of this template (for each package) is as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Set up the test environment - loading of packages, setting working
  directory and options;
\item
  Summary of tested datasets;
\item
  Loop over datasets:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\alph{enumii}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    setting parameters for a specific dataset,
  \item
    selecting benchmark options,
  \item
    training a neural network with a tuned function for each package,
  \item
    calculation of convergence metrics (RMSE, MAE, WAE)\footnote{We
      measure the quality of our model by RMSE, but the mean absolute
      error (MAE) and the worst absolute error (WAE) may help
      distinguish packages with close RMSE values. See Appendix A for
      definition of convergence metrics.},
  \item
    plot each training over one initial graph, then plot the best
    result,
  \item
    add results to the appropriate existing record (*.csv file) and
  \item
    clear the environment for next loop.
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  Clearing up the environment for the next package. It is optional to
  print warnings.
\end{enumerate}

To simplify this process, we developed tools in the \pkg{NNbenchmark}
package, of which the first version was created as part of GSoC 2019. In
GSoC 2020, 3 functions encapsulating the template were added that had
been made generic with an extensive use of the very helpful
\code{do.call} function from \pkg{base} package:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  In \code{trainPredict\_1mth1data} a neural network is trained on one
  dataset and then used for predictions, with several utilities. Then
  the performance of the neural network is exported, plotted and/or
  summarized.
\item
  \code{trainPredict\_1data} serves as a wrapper function for
  \code{trainPredict\_1mth1data} for multiple methods.
\item
  \code{trainPredict\_1pkg} serves as a wrapper function for
  \code{trainPredict\_1mth1data} for multiple datasets.
\end{enumerate}

A function for the summary of accuracy and speed, \code{NNsummary}, was
also added. The package repository is
\url{https://github.com/pkR-pkR/NNbenchmark}, with package templates in
\url{https://github.com/pkR-pkR/NNbenchmarkTemplates}.

An example of a call to \code{trainPredict\_1pkg} is given in Appendix
C.

\textbf{3. Ease of use scoring}

We define ease-of-use measures to rate NN packages on their
user-friendliness. Based on our understanding of what a user may be
required to know or do when using a neural network package, we consider:
a measure for the availability of appropriate utility functions; a
measure for (non-trivial) examples and sufficient documentation
(well-written manual, vignette(s)); and a measure to rate the clarity of
the \textsf{R} call to fit a given neural network. Our rating is as
follows.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Utilities in R to deal with NN - maximum of 1 star

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\alph{enumii}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    a predict function exists = 0.5 stars
  \item
    scaling capabilities exist = 0.5 stars
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  Sufficient and reliable documentation - maximum of 2 stars

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\alph{enumii}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    the existence of useful and relevant example(s)/vignette(s)

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      clear, with regression = 1 star
    \item
      unclear, examples use iris or are for classification only = 0.5
      stars
    \item
      no examples = 0 stars
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    input/output is clearly documented, e.g., what values are expected
    and returned by a function

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      clear input and output = 1 star
    \item
      only one is clear = 0.5 stars
    \item
      both are not documented = 0 stars
    \end{itemize}
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  User-friendly call to fit a NN

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\alph{enumii}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    simple one-line call or a single function = 2 stars
  \item
    multiple-lines call to a single function = 1 star
  \item
    multiple-lines call to many functions = 0 stars
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

Hence, to inform users about the usability of packages, the
documentation ease-of-use measure ranges from 0 to 3 stars, while the
utility and the R call from 0 to 2 stars.

\hypertarget{phase-3---collection-of-and-analysis-of-results}{%
\subsection{Phase 3 - Collection of and analysis of
results}\label{phase-3---collection-of-and-analysis-of-results}}

\hypertarget{results-collection}{%
\subsubsection{Results collection}\label{results-collection}}

Looping over the datasets using each package template, we collected
results in the relevant package directories in the templates repository.
A large number of runs have been carried out in order to obtain the best
result for every package.

\hypertarget{analysis}{%
\subsubsection{Analysis}\label{analysis}}

To rank how well and how fast a package converged, we developed the
following method:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  The results datasets are loaded into the \textsf{R} environment as one
  large list. The dataset names, \code{package:algorithm} names and all
  10 run numbers, durations, and RMSE are extracted from that list.
\item
  For the duration score (DUR), the duration is averaged by dataset. 3
  criteria for the RMSE score by dataset are calculated:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\alph{enumii}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    The minimum value of RMSE for each \code{package:algorithm} as a
    measure of their best performance;
  \item
    The median value of RMSE for each \code{package:algorithm} as a
    measure of their average performance, without the influence of
    outliers;
  \item
    The spread of the RMSE values for each package which is measured by
    the difference between the median and the minimum RMSE (d51).
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  Then, the ranks are calculated for every dataset and the results are
  merged into one wide dataframe.

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\alph{enumii}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    The duration rank only depends on the duration;
  \item
    For minimum RMSE values, ties are decided by duration mean, then the
    RMSE median;
  \item
    For median RMSE values, ties are decided by the RMSE minimum, then

Table 2 gives the RMSE and time score per package and per algorithm. The
full list of scores is given in Table 5 in Appendix C. We divide our
analysis in two groups: packages implementing second-order algorithms
and packages implementing first-order algorithms. Figure 2 shows the
minimum RMSE value per \code{package:algorithm} for two datasets
\code{mIshigami} and \code{uDreyfus1}, whereas Figure 3 displays the
average computation time. The number on the x-level refers to the RMSE
overall score of the package:algorithm given in Table 2 (last column),
e.g., 8 refers to \pkg{validann}\code{:optim(CG)} which is a very slow
algorithm.

Both figures show that a good overall score does not necessarily imply a
good score on the two datasets under consideration. Furthermore, there
is a break between the TOP10 \code{package:algorithm} and others in
terms of RMSE value. Regarding computation time, we observe that some
package:algorithms are very slow and poor RMSE, e.g.~41 corresponding to
\pkg{AMORE}\code{:BATCHgd}. In the following, we first present the
results for second-order algorithms, then low-order algorithms. Finally,
we list the reasons for discareded packages.

\hypertarget{second-order-algorithms}{%
\subsection{Second-order algorithms}\label{second-order-algorithms}}

Of all approaches, the following second-order algorithms generally
performed better in terms of convergence despite being limited to one
fifth or fewer iterations than the first-order algorithms.

We note that 11 out of 15 of these \code{package:algorithms} use
\code{optim} from \CRANpkg{stats}. 2 of them, \CRANpkg{CaDENCE}`s BFGS
\citep{R-CaDENCE} and \CRANpkg{validann}'s BFGS and L-BFGS-B
\citep{R-validann}, make the call directly. However, it is not clearly
stated in \CRANpkg{CaDENCE}'s documentation that optim's BFGS method has
been chosen rather than one of the other four methods. Furthermore, the
mention of Nelder-Mead in the documentation might suggest that
\code{optim}'s Nelder-Mead method is used. Speed and variation between
results for \CRANpkg{CaDENCE} are also not as good as other packages
that use \code{optim}. This could be because \CRANpkg{CaDENCE} is
intended for probabilistic nonlinear models with a full title of
``Conditional Density Estimation Network Construction and Evaluation''.

By contrast, \CRANpkg{validann} is clearly a package that allows a user
to use all optim's algorithms. \CRANpkg{validann}::L-BFGS-B ranks mostly
lower than \CRANpkg{validann}::BFGS, despite the former method being
more sophisticated. We believe this is due to our efforts to harmonize
parameters, thereby under-utilizing the possibilities of the L-BFGS-B
algorithm. Both \CRANpkg{CaDENCE} and \CRANpkg{validann}'s BFGS are
outperformed by \CRANpkg{nnet}, especially in terms of speed.

\CRANpkg{nnet} \citep{R-nnet} differs from the two packages above
because it uses the \textsf{C} code for BFGS (\code{vmmin.c}) from
\code{optim} (converted earlier from Pascal) directly instead of calling
\code{optim} from \textsf{R}. This may be what allows it to be faster,
but limits the optimization to the single method. \CRANpkg{nnet} is only
beaten by the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) algorithms in terms of
speed. However, there is a larger variation between results (see the
\texttt{RMSEd51} in Appendix C) in comparison to
\CRANpkg{validann}:BFGS. We believe the different default starting
values are the cause of this. For instance, \CRANpkg{nnet} uses a range
of initial random weights of 0.7 while \CRANpkg{validann} uses a value
of 0.5. In spite of these results, the real reason most authors or users
are likely to choose \CRANpkg{nnet} is because it is included in the
distributed base \textsf{R} and is even mentioned as the very first
package in CRAN's task view for machine learning
(\url{https://CRAN.R-project.org/view=MachineLearning}).

Our research found that 6 of the 11 packages tested that use
\code{optim} do so through \CRANpkg{nnet}. Moreover, approximately 8
packages for neural networks, though not tested, use \CRANpkg{nnet}. The
total number of \CRANpkg{nnet} dependencies found through a search
through the offline database of CRAN with \CRANpkg{RWsearch} is 136
packages, although some might be using \CRANpkg{nnet} for the
multinomial log-linear models, not neural networks.

The packages that use \CRANpkg{nnet} for neural networks are often meta
packages with a host of other machine learning algorithms.
\CRANpkg{caret} \citep{R-caret}, also mentioned in the taskview, boasts
238 methods with 13 different neural network packages, under a
deceivingly simple name of ``Classification and Regression Training''.
It has many pre-processing utilities available, as well as other tools.

\CRANpkg{EnsembleBase} \citep{R-EnsembleBase} maybe useful for those who
wish to make ensembles and test a grid of parameters although the
documentation is rather confusing. \CRANpkg{MachineShop}
\citep{R-MachineShop} has 51 algorithms, with some additional
information about the response variable types in the second vignette,
functions for preprocessing and tuning, performance assessment, and
presentation of results. \CRANpkg{radiant.model} \citep{R-radiant.model}
has an unalterable maxit of 10000 in the original package. Perhaps the
author thought this was reasonable as the algorithm, \CRANpkg{nnet}, is
quite fast. We changed this to harmonize the parameters.
\CRANpkg{rminer} \citep{R-rminer} is the only package dependent on
\CRANpkg{nnet} that ranks above \CRANpkg{nnet} at number 2 for minimum
RMSE, and even number 1 in some runs. It also ranks number 1 on the
other accuracy measures (median RMSE, minimum MAE, minimum WAE) and is
only behind \CRANpkg{deepdive} and \CRANpkg{minpack.lm} in terms of
results that are consistent and do not vary (RMSEd51).

The difference is probably from the change of maximum allowable weights
in \CRANpkg{rminer} to 10000 from 1000 in \CRANpkg{nnet}, which is also
probably the reason its fits are slower. \CRANpkg{traineR}
\citep{R-traineR} claims to unify the different methods of creating
models between several learning algorithms.

It is worth noting is that \CRANpkg{nnet} and \CRANpkg{validann} do not
have external normalization, which is especially recommended for
\CRANpkg{validann} . However, some of the packages dependent on
\CRANpkg{nnet} do have this capability and it is included in the scoring
for ease of use. With \pkg{NNbenchmark}, this is done through setting
\code{scale = TRUE} in the function \code{prepare.ZZ}. Note that use of
scaling may complicate the application of constraints, so not be worth
the effort for some users. Nevertheless, users might want scaling, or at
least to have a clear explanation of the method chosen to center the
variables. Scaling of both function and parameters is one of the
features that \CRANpkg{optimx} \citep{R-optimx} incorporates, as some
optimization algorithms can work significantly better on scaled problems
\citep{Nash-nlpor14}.

Of all the packages, only \CRANpkg{monmlp} \citep{R-monmlp} calls
\CRANpkg{optimx}. Since the calls are for BFGS and Nelder-Mead, they
could do better to call \code{optim} directly, though the door is open
to other optimization methods in \CRANpkg{optimx}. However, the author,
Alex J. Cannon who is also the author of \CRANpkg{CaDENCE}, has created
a package meant to fill a certain niche, namely for multi-layer
perceptrons with optional partial monotonicity constraints. GAM-style
effect plots are also an interesting feature. Another package by Cannon
is \CRANpkg{qrnn} \citep{R-qrnn} which uses yet another algorithm:
\code{nlm}, a ``Newton-type'' algorithm, from \CRANpkg{stats}. Although
it's performance is at the bottom of second-order algorithms, sometimes
even being beaten by first-order algorithms, this could also be because
of the intended use of the package compared to the tests here.
\CRANpkg{qrnn} is designed for quantile regression neural networks, with
several options. Cannon has included automatic scaling for all 3 of his
packages, as is clearly documented.

\pkg{stats} also includes \code{nls}, for nonlinear least squares, which
defaults to an implementation of the second-order algorithm referred to
as Gauss-Newton. However, in its documentation, \code{nls} warns against
``zero-residual'' or even small residual problems. \citep[Section
6.4.1]{Nash-nlpor14} This was one of the motivations for \CRANpkg{nslr}
\citep{R-nlsr}. nlsr uses a variant \citep{jn77ima} of the
Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm versus the plain Gauss-Newton of
\code{nls}, and modifies the relative offset convergence criterion to
avoid a zero divide when residuals are small. \CRANpkg{minpack.lm}
\citep{minpack.lm} offers another Marquardt approach. Where
\CRANpkg{nlsr} is entirely in \textsf{R}, and also allows for symbolic
or automatic derivatives (which are not relevant to the present study),
\CRANpkg{minpack.lm} uses compiled \textsf{Fortran} and \textsf{C} code
for some important computations. Its structure is also better adapted to
use features already available in \code{nls} that may be important for
some uses.

However, despite the 2 packages ultimately performing well on all runs
(capable of being in the top 3 for RMSE and not slow), there are some
reasons why users might hesitate to choose them.

First, both require the full formula of the neural network including
variables and parameters. Secondly, they require good starting values to
achieve the best convergence. Notice that in Table 1, \code{minpack.lm}
does not have a high rank. This is because we removed the random
Gaussian start values we had originally used which means the default
start values of \code{minpack.lm} were not appropriate for our datasets.
We suspect \CRANpkg{nlsr}'s performance on convergence would have
similarly dropped if it was possible to use \CRANpkg{nlsr} with no
user-set starting values and the author's chosen default values were
inadequate. \code{nls} deals with this by suggesting a companion
function in \CRANpkg{stats}, \code{selfStart}. Finally, both packages
were able to find better minima when the dataset was scaled. With no
starting values and no scaling, \code{minpack.lm:nlsLM} fails on
\code{uNeuroOne} but performance is better on Friedman \& Ishigami
datasets. On the other hand, with no start values and no scaling, it
fails on everything but \code{mFriedman}, \code{mIshigami},
\code{uDmod2}, and the Dreyfus datasets. Similarly, there is also a
notable drop in performance for \CRANpkg{nlsr} without scaling on the
Gauss datasets and \code{mRef153}. To conclude, both packages provide
algorithms that are capable of doing well on our datasets, but may not
be suitable for less experienced users. The vignettes for \CRANpkg{nlsr}
and earlier book \citep{Nash-nlpor14} may be useful.

\CRANpkg{brnn} \citep{R-brnn} is an implementation of the Gauss-Newton
algorithm in \textsf{R} that does not rely on \code{nls} or \code{nlm}
from \CRANpkg{stats}. Although it is well-documented and has good speed,
\CRANpkg{brnn}'s implementation of the Gauss-Newton algorithm still
ranks below some of the previously mentioned BFGS and
Levenberg-Marquardt tools in terms of its global minimum RMSE. We found
2 reasons that we believe to be the cause of this. First, its model uses
one parameter fewer than the other algorithms. Only datasets
\code{uDreyfus1} and \code{uDreyfus2} which are purely 3 hidden neurons
ignore the first term. Second, \CRANpkg{brnn} does not minimize the sum
of squares of the errors but the sum of squares of the errors plus a
penalty on the parameters. In certain circumstances -- especially with
an almost singular Jacobian matrix as with \code{mDette},
\code{mIshigami}, \code{mRef153}, \code{uGauss3}, and \code{uNeuroOne}
-- this will avoid issues with highly correlated parameters.

The only second-order algorithm which we are unable to recommended from
the results of our research is \CRANpkg{snnR} \citep{R-snnR}. It ranked
among the 10 worst algorithms for minimum RMSE out of all 60 algorithms,
but this package, focusing on Sparse Neural Networks for Genomic
Selection in Animal Breeding, might prove useful in that perspective.

\hypertarget{lower-order-algorithms}{%
\subsection{Lower-order algorithms}\label{lower-order-algorithms}}

Packages with first-order algorithms can be broadly categorized into 2
types: (a) those that allow for one hidden layer (b) those that allow
for more than one hidden layer.

\textbf{A. One hidden layer}

The first category is comprised of either packages that also include
second-order algorithms previously discussed or packages that use the
Extreme Learning Machine algorithm. Only 2 packages include both
second-order algorithms and a lower-order algorithm, that is,
\CRANpkg{monmlp} and \CRANpkg{validann}. \CRANpkg{monmlp} has one
algorithm besides BFGS, that is, \CRANpkg{optimx}'s Nelder-Mead.
\CRANpkg{validann} provides the same algorithm but from \code{optim}.
\CRANpkg{validann}'s implementation is slower, as before, but ranks
slightly better for minimum RMSE. Both implementations of Nelder-Mead do
not rank well in minimum RMSE, around 40 out of 60, with similar ranks
for the other criteria. We would also caution users to avoid the other
methods in \CRANpkg{validann} from \code{optim}. From Table 1 it may
appear that \CRANpkg{validann}'s implementation of the Conjugate
Gradient (CG) algorithm finds reasonable minima and thus is a good
option. It consistently ranked in the top 15 with minimum RMSE. However,
it is the slowest algorithm of all 60 algorithms tested. Note, this
includes algorithms from packages that call external libraries outside
\textsf{R} in \textsf{Python} or \textsf{Java} and packages that use as
much as 100,000 iterations. On the other hand, \CRANpkg{validann}'s SANN
algorithm is relatively worse than other packages as it ranks at number
55 for minimum RMSE although it is in the top one third for speed (rank
20).

Packages that implement the ELMR algorithm are similar to SANN from
\CRANpkg{validann} in the sense that they are faster but do not converge
as well as other package's algorithms. The 2 packages that do so,
\CRANpkg{elmNNRcpp} \citep{R-elmNNRcpp} and \CRANpkg{ELMR}
\citep{R-ELMR} are, respectively, number 1 and number 2 in the ranks for
time but 59 and 60 (bottom 2) for minimum RMSE. \CRANpkg{ELMR} converges
slightly worse on all datasets than \CRANpkg{elmNNRcpp} but has
noticeably worse performance on the Gauss datasets, especially
\code{uGauss1}. Even increasing the number of neurons did not lead to
better convergence for those particular datasets.

\textbf{B. More than one hidden layer}

Following the trend of ``deep learning'', the last 9 packages provide
the option for more than one layer with a first-order learning
algorithm. Our results show that they are often either/both slower or
worse at converging than the second-order algorithms with the same
number of neurons or layers than their counterparts. We recommend
choosing better algorithms over more layers for datasets similar to the
ones we used.

Choosing more layers often comes at the expense of speed. An example of
this is the implementation of the first-order algorithm in \CRANpkg{h2o}
\citep{R-h2o}. With the same numbers of neurons it already is quite slow
- coming in at 51 out of the 60 algorithms.

With a default hidden layer size of 2, each with 200 neurons, it takes
around 10 minutes on \code{mFriedman} with a minimum RMSE of 0.0022. On
the other hand, \CRANpkg{nnet} can find a minima of the error function
with a minimum RMSE of 0.0088 in less than a second with fewer neurons
and only one layer. Thus, despite having a ranking of 11 in minimum RMSE
in the final run, beating some of the second-order algorithms, users of
\CRANpkg{h2o} should be wary of the trade off. Moreover, users might
hesitate as it is not actually clear what algorithm is used. The large
number of options to choose from seem capable of changing the basic
algorithm itself into what is considered a different algorithm by other
packages (example: ``adaptive\_rate: Specify whether to enable the
adaptive learning rate (ADADELTA). This option is enabled by default.''
in link, set to false in latest run). Some users also might not want to
setup Java, which is needed, although it is not as painful to setup as
some external libraries.

By far, the hardest package to set up which called external libraries
was \CRANpkg{tensorflow} \citep{R-tensorflow} and its derivatives. In
the summer of 2019, it took quite some time to figure out how things
worked. Then the latest \textsf{TensorFlow} 2.2.0 became available and
we hoped to be able to use the Eager Execution provided to avoid the
\textsf{R} Session crashing in the summer of 2020. Unfortunately, this
led to different problems with the translation between \textsf{R} and
\textsf{Python} so we could not use the 2019 code.
\CRANpkg{tfestimators} \citep{R-tfestimators} also had similar issues
and is even less supported. \CRANpkg{kerasR} \citep{R-kerasR}, which
provides a consistent interface to Keras, a \textsf{Python} API which
provides an easier use interface to TensorFlow, had the same issue. In
the end, we tested the algorithms in \CRANpkg{keras} \citep{R-keras}
with the hope that it would be able to represent the performance of the
other packages.

\CRANpkg{keras} has the second-most number of algorithms, a total of 7,
with most of them being ``adaptive'' algorithms. The highest ranking
algorithm for minimum RMSE is adamax at 23 and the highest ranking
algorithm for speed was rmsprop at 37 (quite slow). However, these
results were achieved with a reasonable GPU so users might want to
decide on whether to use \CRANpkg{keras} based on their own hardware
specifications. Other algorithms did not perform well in terms of
minimum RMSE and the spread of RMSE represented by RMSEd51. As
\CRANpkg{keras} also has many options available, including a
convolutional layer for CNNs, more experienced users may prefer it. On
the other hand, just deciding the learning rate (the default was not
appropriate for our datasets) can be a challenge.

The default learning rates in \CRANpkg{RSNNS} \citep{R-RSNNS} were more
appropriate to use directly. \CRANpkg{RSNNS} is an example of a package
that directly wraps around an external library, the Stuttgart Neural
Network Simulator (SNNS), to provide an easy-to-use interface. This
library is rather large with many implementations of neural networks. It
contains the biggest number of algorithms tested at a total of 8.
Algorithms Rprop and SCG, the best for minimum RMSE, rank at 16 and 17
respectively which is pretty good for a first-order algorithm. Speed for
Rprop is better but SCG's results vary less.

\textbf{Other packages } \CRANpkg{AMORE} \citep{R-AMORE}: Unfortunately,
the focus of the paper behind this package, its unique point, is not
explained or documented well enough.

An addition of some examples using the TAO option as the error criterion
would be helpful for using the TAO-robust learning algorithm, since this
type of error measure is most useful for data with outliers. The
function for creating a dot file to use with
\url{http://www.graphviz.org} is also interesting. ADAPT algorithms
appear to perform better than the BATCH algorithms with the parameters
used in this research.

\CRANpkg{ANN2} \citep{R-ANN2}: This package's implementation of adam or
rmsprop consistently ranked in the top half for minimum RMSE which is
not bad for a first-order algorithm. It is not as accurate as
second-order algorithms but all its algorithms are quite fast.
\textsf{C++} code was used to enhance the speed. Functions for
autoencoding are included with anomaly detection in mind.

\CRANpkg{automl} \citep{R-automl}: It would be easier to use the
algorithms in this package if they did not rely on the beta parameters
and instead had an argument of their own. However, it is nice that there
are notes on what parameters have a higher tuning priority. The package
is rather slow (highest ranking algorithm for speed is RMSprop at 47)
with good enough convergence (highest ranking is adam at 18).

\CRANpkg{deepdive} \citep{R-deepdive}: All algorithms are very good in
terms of little variance between results (see its RMSEd51.score).
However, the results on convergence by minimum RMSE score are not as
good with the worst being gradientDescent which ranks 3rd from the
bottom. There are few exported functions. The novelty of this package is
apparently in the \code{deeptree} and \code{deepforest} functions it
provides.

\CRANpkg{deepnet} \citep{R-deepnet}: This is one of the better
performing implementations of the first-order algorithms
backpropagation, ranking at 18 for minimum RMSE. It's also relatively
fast, ranking at 23 for speed.

\CRANpkg{neuralnet} \citep{R-neuralnet}: Considering that this is the
only package that uses 100000 iterations as its maxit parameter
(excluding BNN which is not included in the official ranks), it can be
considered as not recommended. Nonetheless, the default algorithm,
rprop+ and the similar rprop-, managed to rank 20 and 21 respectively,
out of 60 algorithms for minimum RMSE. These two also do not do badly in
terms of speed. Following, in order, are slr, sag, and traditional
backprop as the worst at rank 48 out of 60 for minimum RMSE. Notes on
documentation show that is rather difficult to configure this package,
and it should probably not be a dependency for other packages that wish
to be more certain of the results. For simple datasets, it is less of an
issue.

autoencoder & AP & Provide a sparse autoencoder, an unsupervised algorithm that learns useful features from the data its given (::autoencode)\\
BNN & RE* & Use a feed forward neural network to perform regression. It is unclear whether it fits the form of perceptron in the scope. It states that it is intended for variable selection, although how exactly the package would be used to do so is missing. Also the source code is written in C that users of R might not understand. Performance is slowÂ : need 100.000 iterations. (::BNNsel-examples \& abstract of paper)\\
Buddle & CL & Did not include regression in 2019. Unfortunately, the version we tested in 2020 could not be used properly for regression either. See the examples (::TrainBuddle)\\

\subsection{Further analysis of TOP5
packages}\label{further-analysis-of-top5-packages}}

In this subsection, we perform a second round analysis with a larger
dataset with a focus on the Top 5 packages given Table 2. That is, we
consider packages \texttt{nlsr}, \texttt{rminer}, \texttt{nnet},
\texttt{validann} with algorithm BFGS and \texttt{MachineShop}. We fit
the NN packages on Simon Wood's Gaussian dataset, see \texttt{bWoodN1}
in dataset description, which contains 20,000 rows with 6 inputs valued
in {[}0,1{]} for a (single) numeric output. Due to the non-linear
functions considered, see Appendix B, the link between the output and
each explanatory variable is highly nonlinear which affects deeply the
fitting time. Table 4 gives the metric performance over 20 runs of these
Top 5 five packages on \texttt{bWoodN1}.

We observe that the minimum RMSE (over 20 runs) is very similar for all
package, yet \texttt{rminer} and \texttt{validann} are little bit behind
others. The median RMSE and D51 RMSE reveal the very good fits by
\texttt{rminer}, and it is also true for other metric norms: WAE and
MAE. Regarding computation time, the two best in class are \texttt{nnet}
and \texttt{MachineShop}.

Figures in Appendix E provides some insights where a package performs
reasonably well with respect to one explanatory variable and where the
fit misses the correct behavior of an explanatory variable. It displays
the average response per rounded explanatory variable for the predicted,
the empirical and the theoretical values. That is, the empirical value
and the predicted value for the \(j\)th explanatory variable are
respectively computed at x-value \(x\) as \[
\bar y^{emp}_j(x) =  \left(\sum_{i=1}^n y_i 1_{r(x_{i,j}) = x} \right)
\left(\sum_{i=1}^n 1_{r(x_{i,j}) = x}\right)^{-1},~
\bar y^{pred}_j(x) = \left(\sum_{i=1}^n \hat y_i 1_{r(x_{i,j}) = x} \right) 
\left(\sum_{i=1}^n 1_{r(x_{i,j}) = x}\right)^{-1} ,
\] where \(r()\) denotes the round function with two decimal places and
\(y_i, \hat y_i\) stand respectively for the \(i\)th observed response
and the \(i\)th predicted response. For instance, \texttt{MachineShop},
\texttt{nnet}, \texttt{nlsr} do not correctly capture the sinusoidal
aspect of explanatory variable \(x_5\) on the expected response, whereas
\texttt{rminer}, \texttt{validann} miss the increasing non-linear trend
of explanatory variable \(x_1\) on the expected response.
