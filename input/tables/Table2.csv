appnn;AP;This package provides a feed forward neural network to predict the amyloidogenicity propensity of polypeptide sequences (DESC)
autoencoder;AP;This package provides a sparse autoencoder, an unsupervised algorithm that learns useful features from the data its given (::autoencode)
BNN;RE*;This package uses a feed forward neural network to perform regression as provided in the examples, however, it is unclear whether it fits the form of perceptron that is the scope of our research. Moreover, it states that it is intended for variable selection. Although how exactly the package would be used to do so isn't accessible in the package, especially considering the source code is based on .c code that users of R might not understand. It's performance is slow, which may have to do with the 100.000 iterations it needs, although quite accurate for simple datasets. (::BNNsel-examples & abstract of paper)
Buddle;CL;This package did not include regression in 2019. Unfortunately, the version we tested in 2020 could not be used properly for regression either. See the examples (::TrainBuddle)

DamiaNN;RE;This package was designed specificly for training datasets from Numerai, <https://numer.ai/>. We were unable to adapt it to our datasets even after exporting functions from the interactive interface (DESC, help pages)
deep;CL;"This package seems to implement a perceptron to classify data (implicitly known from choice of iris as example & in source code: output = function(inputs) {
            as.integer(sum(ws*inputs) - bias > 0)
        },)"
deepNN;RE;This package is another implementation of deep learning. Its input format of lists of vectors is not standard require users to understand how to use lapply or other functions to convert the format of their data. Univariate datasets can't be used with the functions and we could not manage to adapt it to 2020 code so this package is not in the final loop (::train)

evclass;CL;This package provides an evidential neural network that outputs Dempster-Shafer mass functions (DESC)

GMDH2;CL;This package provides GMDH type neural network algorithms for performing binary classification (DESC)
GMDHreg;RE*;"Regression using GMDH algorithms (Title in DESC). We only managed to tested the COMBI algorithm (the most basic and first in the vignette) on the multivariate datasets (it only works for multivariate datasets). It is strangely slow on the ""easy"" datasets, mFriedman and mRef153. The convergence is relatively not good considering the ammount of layers."

leabRa;RE;This package provides the local error driven and associative biologically realistic algorithm (Leabra) from O'Reilly 1996. However, since it combines supervised and unsupervised learning, it did not fit the scope of our research (DESC)
learNN;CL;This package implements some basic neural networks from \url{http://qua.st/} (DESC). It's examples seem to point to binary classification (::learn_gd, ::learn_bp)
LilRhino;AP;This package provides binary neural networks meant for reducing data (DESC), a random forest style collection of neural networks for classification (::Random_Brains), and code for even more purposes. Documentation is satisfyingly clear for a package for applications: a 3 layer network with an adam optimizer, with an explanation of its activation functions (::Binary_Network). Unfortunately, the packages it chooses for neural networks are not ones we would recommend for regression. However, they may prove to be a good choice for classification in the future (???)
